Do 3 tests of 4 iterations.
- The 4 iterations will consist of:
        2 where the drone is in "hover-mode" (propellers are spinning but no additional throttle is given)
        2 where additional throttle is given in on/off patterns
- The 3 tests will consist of:
        1 where the external IMU is located as close to the end of the arm of the drone as possible
        1 where the external IMU is located half way along the arm
        1 where the external IMU is located as close to the center of the drone as possible
        
Be advised!
- All throttle values are essentially void, since the autopilot of the drone speeds up the motors to full thrust when the system doesn't actually
take off when given the input to. Hence, all throttle values should essentially be viewed as maxiumum throttle.
